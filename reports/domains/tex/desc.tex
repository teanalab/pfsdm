Figures~\ref{fig:btc2009} and~\ref{fig:relevant} show numbers of entities for
Top-20 Pay-Level Domains for the whole BTC-2009 dataset and relevant results
from SemSearch Challenge judgments only respectively. It can be observed that in
BTC-2009 dataset entities are significantly skewed towards DBpedia, and for
SemSearch Challenge this disproportion is even higher as was noted in
\cite{balog2013test}. Speaking of numbers, in the whole BTC-2009 dataset
DBpedia entities constitute $34.6\%$ of all entities and in relevance judgments
they constitute $48.9\%$ of all relevant results.

% Starting from BTC-2012 \cite{btc-2012} the problem was mostly solved as can be
% seen in \cite{btc-2012-stats}
