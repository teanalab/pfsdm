Figures~\ref{fig:btc2009} and~\ref{fig:relevant} show numbers of entities for
Top-20 Pay-Level Domains for the whole BTC-2009 dataset and relevant results
from SemSearch Challenge judgments only respectively. It can be observed that in
BTC-2009 dataset entities are significantly skewed towards DBpedia, and for
SemSearch Challenge this disproportion is even higher as was noted in
\cite{balog2013test}. Speaking of numbers, in the whole BTC-2009 dataset
DBpedia entities constitute $34.6\%$ of all entities and in relevance judgments
they constitute $48.9\%$ of all relevant results.

% Starting from BTC-2012 \cite{btc-2012} the problem was mostly solved as can be
% seen in \cite{btc-2012-stats}

\section{Feature usefulness analysis}

We've analyzed significance of our features for different types of concepts
using one-sided Mann-Whitney test (significance level $= 0.01$). We've observed
that for Field Probability feature for concepts of type \emph{attribute} values
of feature for \emph{attributes} field are significantly higher than values for
all three names fields (\emph{names}, \emph{similar entity names}, and
\emph{related entity names}); for \emph{entity} and \emph{relation} concept
types feature value for all names fields is significantly higher than values for
both \emph{attributes} and \emph{categories} fields; for \emph{type} concepts
Field Probability values for \emph{categories} field is significantly higher than values
for all other fields. For Top Score feature values for \emph{attribute} concepts
for \emph{attributes} field is higher than values for all other fields; for
\emph{relation} concepts values for \emph{similar entity names} are
significantly higher than values for all other fields.
